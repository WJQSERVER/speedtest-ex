# SpeedTest-EX

This project is a significant refactor of the [speedtest-go](https://github.com/librespeed/speedtest-go) project. [speedtest-go](https://github.com/librespeed/speedtest-go) is a Go language reimplementation of the backend for [librespeed](https://github.com/librespeed/speedtest), while this project is a further refactor based on [speedtest-go](https://github.com/librespeed/speedtest-go). LiberSpeed is an open-source network speed testing project that uses PHP for its backend, whereas this project uses Go and the Gin framework for its backend, making the program more lightweight and easier to deploy.

**‚ùó Note**: Based on the principle of web speed testing, the program generates useless blocks for testers to download to calculate the actual downstream bandwidth, which carries a risk of being maliciously flooded with traffic. After sharing your speed test page externally, please monitor the server's traffic usage to avoid abnormal traffic usage.

## Features
- **Lightweight**: No additional environment required; just download the binary file to run. (Docker images are also more lightweight)
- **Easy to deploy**: Embedded frontend page, no additional configuration needed for deployment.
- **Efficient**: Based on the Gin framework, with strong concurrency handling capabilities and fast response times.

## Differences from speedtest-go
- **Web Framework**: speedtest-go uses the Chi framework, while this project uses the Gin framework.
- **IPinfo**: speedtest-go uses the ipinfo.io API to obtain IP information; this project is compatible with the ipinfo.io API and can also use [WJQSERVER-STUDIO/ip](https://github.com/WJQSERVER-STUDIO/ip) to provide IP information for self-hosted services.
- **Result Charts**: This project includes result charts for easier viewing of speed test results.
- **Clearer Configuration Files**: Improved configuration file structure.
- **Frontend Page**: Embedded frontend page, no additional configuration needed for deployment. (Still maintains compatibility with the liberspeed frontend)
- **Rewritten**: Most components have been rewritten and optimized, making the program easier to maintain while improving some performance.
